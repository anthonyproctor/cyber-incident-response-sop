# Cyber Incident Response SOP Project

A comprehensive project that demonstrates the development of a **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** for cyber operations, including tools and workflows for effective incident response.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project addresses the critical need for standardized and efficient cyber incident response processes. It includes:
1. **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):** A detailed document outlining step-by-step processes for incident detection, response, and recovery.
2. **Cyber Defense Incident Tracker:** A customizable tracker template for logging and managing incidents.
3. **Incident Response Workflow Flowchart:** A visual representation of the incident response process.
